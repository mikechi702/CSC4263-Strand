# CSC4263-Strand

Strand is a 2D platforming puzzle game built in Unity developed for LSU's video game design class during Spring 2023.

In Strand, you control a rover isolated in space in a mysterious timespace anomaly known as "the Strand."

Players must utilize the rover's built-in time jump drive to travel to different times of the same levels, and use that time drive to manipulate timespace anomalies in order to solve these puzzles and escape the Strand.

Executable folder will be available at a later date.
